# Web Scraping for Product Information

Web Scraping for Product Information is a Python program that extracts product details, including names, prices, and ratings, from an e-commerce website. The extracted data is then saved in a structured format, such as a CSV file.

## Overview

This project provides a Python script that automates the process of scraping product information from an e-commerce website. It demonstrates how to use the `requests` library to fetch HTML content from a web page and Beautiful Soup for parsing the HTML. The extracted data is then written to a CSV file for further analysis or usage.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
